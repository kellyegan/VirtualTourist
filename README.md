# VirtualTourist

An iOS app that displays photos based on geographic location.

App uses Networking, CoreData and Flickr API. Completed as part of my iOS Nanodegree from Udacity.

I supplemented the app requirements with a "Random City" button to find a new city on the globe, and a Photo Details view to see pictures in more detail.
